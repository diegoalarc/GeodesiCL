# <a href="https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL">`GeodesiCL`</a>: A little journey into Geometric Geodesy.
###### Attention: Still in beta test
***
## To begin with
This package was created to introduce topographical and related engineers in the area of [Topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) and [Geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy) as a basic introduction to __Geometric Geodesy__ applying the necessary basic formulas.

This was a project created between [Diego Alarcón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and [Karla Riquelme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlariquelmecarrillo/) seeing the need to introduce the new generation of professionals in the learning of software language and in turn present free software.

The `Ellipsoids` within the package are as follows:
| __Ellipsoids__     | __a__       | __1/f__       |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
| PSAD56             | 6378388     | 297           |
| SAD69              | 6378160     | 298.25        |
| WGS84              | 6378137     | 298.257223563 |
| GRS80              | 6378137     | 298.257222101 |
| GRS67              | 6378160     | 298.25        |
| Airy 1830          | 6377563.396 | 299.3249646   |
| Bessel 1841        | 6377397.155 | 299.1528434   |
| Clarke 1880        | 6378249.145 | 293.465       |
| Clarke 1866        | 6378206.4   | 294.9786982   |
| International 1924 | 6378388     | 297           |
| Krasovsky 1940     | 6378245     | 298.2997381   |

## Functions

Here you can see the `functions` contained in the package. Is it possible to read its description by copying to the console `? + function` or if you want to see an example just using `example(function)` like the following:

`ARCH`: Rope reduction to elliptical arch.
```r
?ARCH

example(ARCH)
```
`cartesian`: To convert from Geodesic to Cartesian.
```r
?cartesian

example(cartesian)
```
`E2`: To calculate 1-e^2.
```r
?E2

example(E2)
```
`E3`: To calculate 1-e^2*sen(lat)^2.
```r
?E3

example(E3)
```
`geodesic`: To convert from Cartesian to Geodesic.
```r
?geodesic

example(geodesic)
```
`geodis`: Reduction of the horizontal distance to the Ellipsoid.
```r

example(geodis)
```
`LongLatToUTM`: To convert from Longitude and Latitude to UTM.
```r
?LongLatToUTM

example(LongLatToUTM)
```
`M`: To calculate the value of M.
```r
?M

example(M)
```
`N`: To calculate the value of N.
```r

## Installation
#### Install system dependencies
Please make sure that the [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/) libraries are installed on your system:

 * Windows: use the [OSGeo4W installer](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).
 * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev`
 * MacOS: ask Siri.

We currently have two ways to install this package, as it is not yet finalized for posting to [CRAN Project](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### First option

After we already have the `system dependencies`, to use this package you should install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). Next, you need to install the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html">`devtools`</a> package in order to start with the installation of the `GeodesiCL` package, then just copy and paste the following command into the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) console:

```r
install.package("devtools")
install_github("diegoalarc/GeodesiCL")
```
!["Example Image"](https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL/blob/main/image/r1.png "Example Image")

### Second option

If you already have experience using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and also have installed <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html">`devtools`</a>  you could just copy the following command:

```r
devtools::install_github("diegoalarc/GeodesiCL")
```
!["Example Image 2"](https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL/blob/main/image/r2.png "Example Image 2")

### Interesting fact

As entertaining fact, the name of the package is because __geodesy__ is written __geodesia__ in Spanish and CL represents the acronym of my country __Chile__ but strangely you can see an A writing __GeodesiA__ in Spanish (lol).

***
### Contribution

We do hope you enjoy the package and give us your __feedback__ in order to make this package better, easy and accurate as possible.! Open an issue to start a discussion:
