# GeodesiCL

This package was created to introduce topographical and related engineers in the area of [Topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) and [Geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy) as a basic introduction to Geometric Geodesy applying the necessary basic formulas.

This was a project created between [Diego Alarcón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and [Karla Riquelme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlariquelmecarrillo/) seeing the need to introduce the new generation of professionals in the learning of software language and in turn present free software.

We currently have two ways to install this package, as it is not yet finalized for posting to [cran] (https://cran.r-project.org/).

## First option

To use this package you should install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and simply copy and paste the following command into the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) console:

## Second option

Or if you already have experience using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and also have installed devtools you could just copy the following command:
