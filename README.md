# <a href="https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL">`GeodesiCL`</a>: A little journey into Geometric Geodesy.
###### Attention: We are ready to go!!
***
## To begin with
This package was created to introduce topographical and related engineers in the area of [Topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) and [Geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy) as a basic introduction to __Geometric Geodesy__ applying the necessary basic formulas.

This was a project created between [Diego Alarcón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and [Karla Riquelme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlariquelmecarrillo/) seeing the need to introduce the new generation of professionals in the learning of software language and in turn present free software.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">`Ellipsoids`</a> within the package are as follows:
| `Ellipsoids`       | `a`         | `1/f`         |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
| PSAD56             | 6378388     | 297           |
| SAD69              | 6378160     | 298.25        |

## Functions

Here you can see the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/function">`functions`</a> contained in the package. Is it possible to read its description by copying to the console `? + function` or if you want to see an example just using `example(function)` like the following:

###### Check out each example, since most functions work with data.frame that has a specific order for its data.

`arch`: Rope reduction to elliptical arch.
```r
?arch

example(arch)
```
`cartesian`: To convert from Geographic coordinate to Cartesian coordinate.
```r
?cartesian

example(cartesian)
```
`E2`: To calculate 1-e^2.
```r
?E2

example(E2)
```
`E3`: To calculate 1-e^2*sen(lat)^2.
```r
?E3

example(E3)
```
`geodesic`: To convert from Cartesian coordinate to Geographic coordinate.
```r
?geodesic

example(geodesic)
```
`geodis`: Reduction of the horizontal distance to the Ellipsoid.
```r
?geodis

example(geodis)
```
`LongLatToUTM`: To convert from Geographic coordinate to UTM coordinate.
```r
?LongLatToUTM

example(LongLatToUTM)
```
`M`: To calculate the value of M.
```r

## Installation
#### Install system dependencies
Please make sure that the [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/) libraries are installed on your system:

 * Windows: use the [OSGeo4W installer](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).
 * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev`
 * MacOS: `brew install gdal --HEAD` or `brew install gdal`

For more information on GDAL installation [Click here!](https://medium.com/@egiron/how-to-install-gdal-and-qgis-on-macos-catalina-ca690dca4f91)

We currently have two ways to install this package, as it is not yet finalized for posting to [CRAN Project](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### First option

After we already have the `system dependencies`, to use this package you should install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). Next, you need to install the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html">`devtools`</a> package in order to start with the installation of the `GeodesiCL` package, then just copy and paste the following command into the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("diegoalarc/GeodesiCL")
```
!["Example Image"](https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL/blob/main/man/image/r1.png "Example Image")

### Second option

If you already have experience using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and also have installed <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html">`devtools`</a>  you could just copy the following command:

```r
devtools::install_github("diegoalarc/GeodesiCL")
```
!["Example Image 2"](https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL/blob/main/man/image/r2.png "Example Image 2")

***
### Interesting fact

As entertaining fact, the name of the package is because __geodesy__ is written __geodesia__ in Spanish and CL represents the acronym of my country __Chile__ but strangely you can see an A writing __GeodesiA__ in Spanish (lol).

***
### Contribution

We do hope you enjoy the package and give us your __feedback__ in order to make this package better, easy and accurate as possible! Open an issue to start a discussion:
