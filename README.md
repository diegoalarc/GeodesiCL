# GeodesiCL: A little journey into Geometric Geodesy.
###### Attention: Still in beta test

## To begin with
This package was created to introduce topographical and related engineers in the area of [Topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) and [Geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy) as a basic introduction to Geometric Geodesy applying the necessary basic formulas.

This was a project created between [Diego Alarcón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and [Karla Riquelme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlariquelmecarrillo/) seeing the need to introduce the new generation of professionals in the learning of software language and in turn present free software.

## Second option

Or if you already have experience using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and also have installed devtools you could just copy the following command:

We do hope you enjoy the package and give us your feedback in order to make this package better, easy and accurate as possible.

### Interesting fact
As entertaining fact, the name of the package is because geodesy is written geodesia in Spanish and CL represents the acronym of my country Chile but strangely you can see an A writing GeodesiA in Spanish (lol).
