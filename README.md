# GeodesiCL

This package was created to introduce topographical and related engineers in the area of Topography and Geodesy as a basic introduction to Geometric Geodesy applying the necessary basic formulas.

This was a project created between [Diego Alarcón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and [Karla Riquelme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlariquelmecarrillo/) seeing the need to introduce the new generation of professionals in the learning of software language and in turn present free software.
